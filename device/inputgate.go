// efficiency"): instead of completing every IN URB immediately with
// possibly-duplicate state, devices block until input actually changed (or
// the endpoint's bInterval deadline supplied by the server via ctx) — which
// cuts duplicate-report churn and ships fresh input the moment it arrives.
//
// The gate is a coalescing 1-buffered signal (latest-wins): any number of
// Signal calls between two waits collapse into one wake-up, and the report is
// built from the device's CURRENT state at wake time.
